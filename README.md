# Project Description

This repository contains files related to the project "Single Cell RNA-Seq Analysis of Pancreatic Cells" (https://bf528.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/projects/project_4_scrnaseq/project_4_scrnaseq.html)
In this project, we used raw single-cell sequencing data from a 51-year-old female donor and performed further analyses to recognize the cell type, identify the marker genes and develop the in-depth biological functions for these cell types.
